# PostgreSQL module

Use this module to define a general purpose Postgres 12 db.

## REQUIREMENTS
- .env file with JUST desired password credentials for postgres.
- Double check there's no newline!

## Future
- Currently on a t2.micro with 8GB storage. We can provision more later if needed
- i.e. we'll dump the db to local then redump to new instance
